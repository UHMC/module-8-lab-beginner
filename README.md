# Module 8 - Beginner Lab: Creating A Faucet

## Background
This lab will go over the creation of a faucet smart contract. A faucet is a free source of tokens.

## Meta Information
| Attribute | Explanation |
| - | - |
| Summary | This assignment involves creating, deploying, and interacting with a faucet smart contract. |
| Topics  | Smart contracts, faucets, tokens. |
| Audience | Appropriate for CS1 or a later course. |
| Difficulty | Beginner. |
| Strengths | This assignment exposes students to popular technology (blockchain) and some of its features. |
| Weaknesses | It may be difficult for students to extend smart contracts without programming knowledge and familiarity with the Solidity programming language. |
| Dependencies | Some programming knowledge and an internet-connected computer with a suitable browser (with [MetaMask][MetaMask] installed) for use of [the Remix IDE][Remix]. |
| Variants | Could be used to introduce smart contracts, tokens, or use of general-purpose blockchains. |

## Assignment Instructions
1. Navigate to [https://remix.ethereum.org][Remix].
    * This is our development environment. Here, we can write smart contracts and test them.
2. Click on the "+" at the top left corner of the screen.
    * This will create a new empty document to begin development.
3. Name the document `faucet.sol`.
4. In the blank document, add the following code:
    ```solidity
    // Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for
    pragma solidity ^0.5.1;
    ```
    * This piece of information allows the Solidity compiler to know what set of rules it should use when compiling the contract into bytecode.
